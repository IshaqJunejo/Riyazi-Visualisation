## Meaning
**Riyazi** (written as **رياضي**) is a word used in Sindhi Language, and also in regionally neighbouring Languages, which translates to **Mathematics**.

## Introduction

Riyazi-Visualisation is a small Javascript Project that can help you visualize a few complicated Mathematical Concepts.
This repository contains the Code for creating the Visualizations of Pre-Calculus Concepts.

If you're a Student, you can use this to understand these Mathematical Concepts relatively easily.
If you're an Educator, you can use this to help your students with grasping these Mathematical Concepts and helping them build intuition.

## Concepts

This is a small repository so-far, and only has a few Pre-Calculus Concepts being Visualized, and here is a list of them:

- Pythagorean Theorem
- Linear Equation
- Solution to 2 Linear Equations
- Linear Inequality
- Exponential Equation
- Logarithmic Equation
- Reciprocal of X
- Sine Function
- Cosine Function
- Tangent Function
- Unit Circle
